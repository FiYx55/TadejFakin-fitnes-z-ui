# Fitnes-ai: A .NET MAUI Fitness Planner

Fitnes-ai is a cross-platform mobile application built with .NET MAUI that allows users to create, manage, and track their fitness plans. It provides a comprehensive solution for organizing workouts, browsing exercises, and maintaining a personalized fitness schedule. The application uses a local SQLite database to store all user data, ensuring that everything is available offline.

## Features

*   **Workout Plan Management:** Create multiple workout plans, set an active plan, and delete old ones.
*   **Workout Creation:** Add custom-named workouts (e.g., "Chest Day", "Leg Day") to your plans.
*   **Comprehensive Exercise Library:** Browse a pre-loaded library of exercises, complete with images and muscle group categorization.
*   **Exercise Filtering:** Easily find exercises by searching for their name or filtering by muscle group.
*   **Add Exercises to Workouts:** Add exercises from the library to your workouts, specifying sets, reps, and rest times.
*   **Persistent State:** The active workout plan is saved locally, so the app remembers your choice between sessions.
*   **Offline First:** All data is stored in a local SQLite database, making the app fully functional without an internet connection.
*   **Modern & Responsive UI:** A clean and intuitive user interface built with .NET MAUI XAML.

## Technologies Used

*   **.NET MAUI:** For cross-platform application development (Android, iOS, Windows).
*   **C#:** The primary programming language.
*   **XAML:** For defining the user interface.
*   **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** Architectural pattern for clean separation of concerns.
*   **SQLite & Entity Framework Core:** For local database storage and object-relational mapping.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Used throughout the application for managing services and ViewModels.

## Setup and Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  Open the solution file (`Fitnes-ai.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022 or later.
3.  Ensure you have the **.NET Multi-platform App UI development** workload installed in the Visual Studio Installer.
4.  Restore the NuGet packages (this should happen automatically when you build).
5.  Select your target platform (e.g., Android Emulator, Windows Machine) from the debug dropdown.
6.  Run the application. The database will be automatically created and seeded with exercises on the first launch.

## Project Structure

*   `Fitnes-ai/`: The main project directory.
    *   `Models/`: Contains the entity classes for the database (`WorkoutPlan`, `Workout`, `Exercise`, `ExerciseData`).
    *   `ViewModels/`: Contains the ViewModel classes that provide data and logic to the Views (`PlanViewModel`, `WorkoutViewModel`, etc.).
    *   `Views/`: Contains the XAML pages and their code-behind files (`PlanPage.xaml`, `WorkoutPage.xaml`, etc.).
    *   `App.xaml.cs`: The main application class, responsible for database initialization and seeding.
    *   `AppShell.xaml`: Defines the main navigation structure of the app (the tab bar).
    *   `MauiProgram.cs`: The entry point for the app, where services are registered for dependency injection.
    *   `Resources/Raw/exercises.json`: The JSON file containing the initial exercise data that is seeded into the database.
    *   `Converters/`: Contains custom IValueConverter implementations for XAML data binding.
